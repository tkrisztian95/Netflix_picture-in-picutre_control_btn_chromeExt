This extension adds a new picture-in-picture control button to the video control bar.

On click it opens the video in a floating window (always on top of other windows).

## Description
I decided to make this extension because I missed this control button so much. After I started the work I had to realize there is a solution already by the Google's official PIP extension. [Picture-in-picture extension (by Google):](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg)

But! I still wanted that control button to be there on the Netflix's video player control bar so I did not give up the extra work.
