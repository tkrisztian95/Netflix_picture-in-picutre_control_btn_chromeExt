This extension put a new picture-in-picture control button to the video control bar.

On click it opens the video in a floating window (always on top of other windows).

## Description
I decided to make this extension because I missed this control button so much. After I started the work I had to realize there is a solution already by the Google's official PIP extension. But! I still wanted that control button to seen on the Netflix's video player control bar so I continued the work.
